The hearing shall be conducted at a location convenient to the parties concerned as determined by the Director, OHA, and on a date and time stated. The contractor may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have a full opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the determination. A transcribed record of the proceedings shall be made and shall be made available at cost to the contractor upon request, unless the requirement for the transcribed record is waived by mutual agreement of the contractor and OHA.
