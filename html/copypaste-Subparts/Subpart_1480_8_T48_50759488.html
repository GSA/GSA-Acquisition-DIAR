         <p class="p List1">(a) The CO must insert the provision at 1452.280-4, Indian Economic Enterprise representation, in all solicitations regardless of dollar value solicited under 1480.401(c) or (d) and in accordance with this part.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) To be considered for an award under 1480.401(c) or (d), an offeror must certify that it meets the definition of “Indian Economic Enterprise” (as defined in 1480.201) in response to a specific solicitation set-aside in accordance with the Buy Indian Act and this part; and
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The enterprise must meet the definition of “Indian Economic Enterprise” throughout the following time periods:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) At the time an offer is made in response to a solicitation;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) At the time of contract award; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) During the full term of the contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If, after award, a contractor no longer meets the eligibility requirements as it has certified and as set forth in this section, then the contractor must provide the CO with written notification within 3 days of its failure to comply with the eligibility requirements. The notification must include:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A description of actions, if any, that must be taken to regain eligibility.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Failure to provide written notification required by paragraph (d) of this section means that:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible as an IEE for future contract awards under this part; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The CO may consider termination for default if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) A CO will review the representation if an interested party challenges the IEE representation or if the CO has any other reason to question the representation. The CO may ask the offeror for more information to substantiate the representation. Challenges of and questions concerning a specific representation must be referred to the CO or CCO in accordance with subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Subpart_1480_9_T48_50759489.html#Subpart_1480_9_T48_50759489">1480.9</a>.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) Participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an IEE ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Contracting offices must provide copies of the IEE representation to any interested parties upon written request.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The submission of a Solicitation Mailing List Application by an enterprise does not remove the requirement for it to provide representation as an IEE, as required by this part, if it wishes to be considered as an offeror for a specific solicitation. COs may determine the validity of the contents of the applicant's representation.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Any false or misleading information submitted by an enterprise when submitting an offer in consideration for an award set aside under the Buy Indian Act is a violation of the law punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. False claims submitted as part of contract performance are subject to the penalties enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3729 to 3731 and 18 U.S.C. 287.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The CO will review and refer to the appropriate officials all IEE misrepresentation by an offeror or failure to provide written notification of a change in IEE eligibility.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) Only IEEs may participate in acquisitions set aside in accordance with the Buy Indian Act and this part. These procedures support responsible IEEs and prevent circumvention or abuse of the Buy Indian Act.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Eligibility is based on information furnished by the enterprise to a CO in the IEE representation at DIAR 1452.280-4 in response to a specific solicitation under the Buy Indian Act.

</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The CO may also request the Office of the Inspector General (on Form DI-1902 as part of a normal pre-award audit) to assist in determining the eligibility of the low responsive and responsible offerors on Buy Indian Act awards.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) The IEE representation does not relieve the CO of the obligation for determining contractor responsibility, as required by FAR subpart 9.1.
