         <p class="p List1">(a) The CO will provide the contractor with a formal notice that summarizes the events involving the suspected violation and affords the contractor the opportunity to take the action(s) listed under FAR 3.204(b).

A copy of this submission must also be sent to the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. In consultation with the SOL and the OIG, and based on the results of any further discussion with the contractor, its counsel or witnesses, the HCA may make a recommendation to the Director, PAM, pursuant to FAR 3.204(c) and shall provide formal notice to the contractor of such recommendation.
