         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			A protester shall furnish a copy of its complete protest simultaneously to the CO and the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The SOL will furnish promptly GAO's written notice of the protest to the cognizant contracting activity which, in turn, shall promptly transmit copies to the CO.

Reports shall be prepared with the assistance of the local attorney-advisor of the SOL. A statement shall be included giving an estimate of the length of time an award may be delayed without significant expense or difficulty in performance. If appropriate, the report shall contain a statement regarding any urgency for the acquisition and the extent to which a delay in award may result in significant performance difficulties or additional expense to the Government. The contracting activity shall submit the CO's report to the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property, who will then submit it to GAO and provide a copy to each interested party who responded to the notification pursuant to FAR 33.104(a)(2).
</p>

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The written finding to authorize continued contract performance, notwithstanding protest, shall be written by the CO, reviewed by the SOL, and approved by the HCA.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The SOL shall be responsible for notifying GAO of the finding to continue contract performance not withstanding protest.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Notice to GAO.</em> The CO shall prepare the report required by FAR 33.104(g), and coordinate it with the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property, and the Director, PAM, prior to HCA signature (signature level not redelegable).
