         <p class="p List1">(a) Policy. DOI regulations governing the conduct and responsibilities of regular and special employees are contained in 43 CFR part 20. Additional guidance is contained in the DOI publication “Ethics Guide for Department of the Interior Employees.” Copies of the Guide can be obtained from the Bureau/Office Ethics Office or on the Internet at <em class="ph i">http://www.doi.gov/ethics/.</em> With regard to the provisions of 43 CFR part 20, officials who participate personally and substantially in DOI procurements (as defined in FAR 3.104-3), may not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or anything of monetary value from a competing contractor during the conduct of a procurement.

         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			Officials may not accept or solicit from any competing contractor any services that involve the development of specifications, statements of work, evaluation criteria, or formal cost estimates to be used in a procurement unless such services are formally contracted for pursuant to the FAR and DIAR, and until the organizational COI provisions in FAR Subpart 9.5 have been fully addressed. This does not preclude COs from issuing formal Requests for Comment (RFC) or draft RFPs.

         <p class="p List1">(b) With the exception of contracting personnel, proposal evaluators and advisors are not required to file a Confidential Financial Disclosure Report (SF450) unless they occupy positions identified in 43 CFR 20.735.30(b). Therefore, when an individual is appointed as an evaluator or advisor, he/she must sign and return to the CO a Conflict of Interest Certificate in a format approved by the HCA. If a potential COI exists, the appointee must not be allowed to evaluate or advise on an offeror's proposal until the conflict has been resolved with the servicing Ethics Counselor.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) During the evaluation process, each evaluator and advisor is responsible for ensuring that there are no financial or employment interests that conflict or give the appearance of conflicting with his or her duty to evaluate proposals impartially and objectively. Examples of situations that may be prohibited or represent a potential COI include:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Financial interest, including stocks and bonds, in a firm that submits, or is expected to submit, an offer in response to the solicitation;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Outstanding financial commitments to any actual or potential offeror;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Employment in any capacity, even if otherwise permissible, by any actual or potential offeror;

         <p class="p List2">(4) Employment within the last 12 months by an actual or potential offeror;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Any non-vested pension or re-employment rights, or interest in profit sharing or stock bonus plans arising out of past employment by an actual or potential offeror; or

         <p class="p List2">(6) Employment of any member of the immediate family by an actual or potential offeror.
